2. Difference between a Library and Framework?
### **Difference Between a Library and a Framework**  

A **library** is a collection of reusable functions or modules that developers can call when needed. It provides specific functionalities without enforcing a strict structure.
The developer remains in control of the flow of execution and decides when and how to use the library. For example, **React.js** is a UI library that allows developers to build 
components as needed without dictating the overall application structure.  

A **framework**, on the other hand, provides a complete structure for building an application. It follows the principle of **Inversion of Control (IoC)**, meaning the framework dictates the flow of execution and calls the developer‚Äôs code when required. This reduces flexibility but ensures consistency and best practices. For example, **Angular** is a frontend framework that enforces a particular way of building applications, including routing, state management, and component structure.  

The key difference is: **"You call a library, but a framework calls you."** Libraries offer flexibility, while frameworks provide structure and enforce a specific way of working. üöÄ

3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?
A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a globally distributed network of servers that helps deliver web content (such as images, videos, CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files) faster by caching them in multiple locations closer to users.

Why Do We Use a CDN?
Faster Load Times üöÄ ‚Äì Content is served from the nearest server to reduce latency.
Improved Website Performance ‚ö° ‚Äì Reduces server load by distributing traffic.
Better Scalability üìà ‚Äì Handles high traffic efficiently without overloading the origin server.
Enhanced Security üîí ‚Äì Protects against DDoS attacks and provides SSL/TLS encryption.
Global Reach üåç ‚Äì Ensures a smooth user experience for audiences worldwide.
Popular CDN providers include Cloudflare, Akamai, AWS CloudFront, and Google Cloud CDN.

4. Why is React known as React?
React is called **"React"** because it is designed to efficiently **react** to changes in data and update the user interface accordingly.  

### **Why the Name "React"?**  
1. **Reactive UI Updates** ‚Äì React **automatically re-renders** components when data changes, making the UI highly responsive.  
2. **Virtual DOM Optimization** ‚Äì Instead of updating the entire page, React **efficiently updates only the necessary parts** using its **Virtual DOM**.  
3. **Component-Based Architecture** ‚Äì React breaks the UI into reusable **components** that can react independently to data changes.  
4. **Declarative Programming** ‚Äì Developers declare how the UI should look based on state, and React reacts to state changes by updating the UI accordingly.  

### **Summary**  
The name **"React"** reflects its core functionality: **reacting to data changes and efficiently updating the UI**. üöÄ

5. What is `crossorigin` in the `<script>` Tag?

The `crossorigin` attribute in the `<script>` tag is used when loading **external scripts** (from a different domain) and controls how the browser handles **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** requests.  

### **Why is `crossorigin` Used?**  
- When a script is loaded from a **different origin (CDN, third-party domain, etc.)**, the browser may restrict access to the script's data due to **security policies**.  
- The `crossorigin` attribute ensures that the script is fetched **correctly** and allows controlled access to error details.  

---

### **`crossorigin` Attribute Values**
1. **`anonymous` (Default)**  
   - The script is fetched without sending user credentials (cookies, HTTP authentication, etc.).  
   - Works only if the external server allows anonymous requests (CORS headers).  
   - Example:
     ```html
     <script src="https://cdn.example.com/script.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
     ```

2. **`use-credentials`**  
   - The script is fetched **with user credentials** (cookies, authentication headers).  
   - Requires the external server to allow credentials via the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` header.  
   - Example:
     ```html
     <script src="https://cdn.example.com/script.js" crossorigin="use-credentials"></script>
     ```

3. **No `crossorigin` Attribute**  
   - The browser loads the script **without CORS checks** (default behavior for same-origin scripts).  
   - For cross-origin scripts, errors won't be visible in the console due to security restrictions.  

---

### **When Should You Use `crossorigin`?**
- **CDN-hosted scripts (e.g., jQuery, React from a CDN)** should use `crossorigin="anonymous"` to allow better error handling.  
- **Scripts requiring authentication** should use `crossorigin="use-credentials"`.  
- **For same-origin scripts**, `crossorigin` is **not needed**.  

Would you like an example of how CORS headers work with this? üöÄ

6. What is diference between React and ReactDOM
### **Difference Between React and ReactDOM**  

**React** and **ReactDOM** are both part of the React library, but they serve different purposes.  

### **1. React (`react` package)**
- **Purpose**: React is the **core library** responsible for creating UI components and managing state.  
- **Used for**: Writing **components, hooks, and handling state** in a React application.  
- **Example Usage**:  
  ```jsx
  import React, { useState } from "react";

  function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>;
  }
  ```

---

### **2. ReactDOM (`react-dom` package)**
- **Purpose**: ReactDOM is responsible for rendering React components into the **actual DOM** in web applications.  
- **Used for**: Interacting with the browser‚Äôs DOM and attaching React components to the root HTML element.  
- **Example Usage**:  
  ```jsx
  import React from "react";
  import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
  import App from "./App";

  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
  root.render(<App />);
  ```

---

### **Key Differences**  
1. **React (`react`) is the core library** ‚Äì it provides component-based UI development, state management, and hooks.  
2. **ReactDOM (`react-dom`) handles rendering** ‚Äì it connects React components to the browser‚Äôs actual DOM.  
3. **React can work independently** (e.g., in React Native, where `react-dom` is not needed), but **ReactDOM is specifically for web applications**.

7. What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
### **Difference Between `react.development.js` and `react.production.js` (via CDN)**  

When using React from a **CDN**, there are two different versions of the library:  

1. **`react.development.js`** ‚Äì Used for development (debugging & testing).  
2. **`react.production.js`** ‚Äì Used for production (optimized for performance).  

---

### **1. `react.development.js` (Development Version)**
- **Larger in size** because it includes helpful **warnings, error messages, and debugging tools**.  
- **Useful for development** as it provides detailed error messages and warnings (e.g., `propTypes` validation, unused states).  
- **Not optimized for performance**, as it includes extra checks for a better developer experience.  

‚úÖ Example (Development CDN):  
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>
```

---

### **2. `react.production.js` (Production Version)**
- **Smaller in size** because debugging features and warnings are removed.  
- **Optimized for performance**, making the app load faster.  
- **Better for end users** as it reduces unnecessary checks and improves rendering speed.  

‚úÖ Example (Production CDN):  
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
```

8. What is async and defer
### **Difference Between `async` and `defer`**  

Both `async` and `defer` are attributes used in the `<script>` tag to control how JavaScript files are loaded in an HTML document. They improve page speed by **loading scripts without blocking** the HTML parsing.  

#### **`async` (Asynchronous Loading)**
When a script has the `async` attribute, the browser **downloads** it in parallel while parsing the HTML. However, once the script is downloaded, it **executes immediately**, pausing HTML parsing until the script runs completely.  

This means scripts with `async` **do not guarantee execution order** if multiple scripts are loaded. It is best used for scripts that don‚Äôt depend on each other or the DOM, such as analytics or advertisements.  

‚úÖ **Example**:  
```html
<script src="script.js" async></script>
```

#### **`defer` (Deferred Execution)**
The `defer` attribute also allows scripts to be downloaded in parallel with HTML parsing. However, unlike `async`, it ensures that scripts **execute only after HTML parsing is fully complete**. Additionally, if multiple scripts have `defer`, they **execute in the order they appear** in the document.  

This makes `defer` ideal for scripts that modify or depend on the DOM structure, ensuring everything is ready before they run.  

‚úÖ **Example**:  
```html
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
```

#### **Key Differences**
1. **Execution Timing** ‚Äì `async` scripts run as soon as they are downloaded, while `defer` scripts wait until the HTML is fully parsed.  
2. **Order of Execution** ‚Äì `async` scripts may execute in **any order**, whereas `defer` scripts execute **in sequence** as they appear.  
3. **Use Cases** ‚Äì `async` is ideal for independent scripts (like ads or analytics), whereas `defer` is best for scripts that modify the DOM.
